							<h2 class="major">Ready for New Challenges</h2>
							<p>I believe a career break was a necessary step in my life, as I had to focus in the family and in all changes that we faced after moving countries twice and re-adapting to new cultures and ways of living. Now I am more than ready to go back to the market and work again in the profession that I love!</p>
