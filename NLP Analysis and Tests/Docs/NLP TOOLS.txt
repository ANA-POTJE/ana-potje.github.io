1) Textblob = great for sentiment analysis, returns "polarity" and "subjectivity" of a text.
           polarity score = range [-1.0, 1.0] (negative / positive)
           subjectivity score = range [0.0, 1.0] (very objective / very subjective)

= extras: definition of a word (dictionary); translate text to another language; language detection; spelling correction; shows a frequency of a specific word in the text.
If we are using Python as a programming language, TextBlob seems to be very straightfoward to implement.

2) Amazon Comprehend = amazing tool but seems to be a package itself, not sure if it can be used inside our app ... (?)

3) GATE Source Credibility = possibly it has what we want in terms of identifying if the URL is reliable etc, but it is an API to be called from our APP - any takers?
