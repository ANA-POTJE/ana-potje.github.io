### Source Credibility API - question
###-------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,
Please can you let me know what are the "credibility-category" range of values and their meanings? For example, what does it mean category = "UNS" ?

Please see below:
           "credibility-resolved-url":"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54278053",
            "credibility-domain":"bbc.co.uk",
            "credibility-score":95,
            "credibility-type":"known",
            "credibility-color":"green",
            "credibility-category":"UNS",
            "credibility-source":"Media Bias/Fact Check",
            "credibility-timestamp":20191001

Many thanks!!!

The credibility-category label is a little undefined. Essentially we pass through any label provided by the original source (in your example Media Bias/Fact Check). There is no exhaustive list of what might be in that field as we are frequently adding new sources which may include new values. What I do know is that UNS meant unspecified. Other labels which I do know are present and which are a little more self explanatory are: left, left center, center, right center, right, pro science, Conspiracy, fake news, clickbait, Conservative, fake, Liberal, Satire, and unreliable. As you can see there is some overlap between these as we made no attempt to normalise them to a fixed set.

Hope that helps,

Mark

Team, more good news today!
I analysed that "Source Credibility" API (sources etc), some info below:

1) The Source "Media Bias/Fact Check" seems the most reliable, we should use it if present otherwise use a different source that the API returns. By the way, all "famous" newspapers seems to have a rating in the "Media Bias/Fact Check" ;)

2) It returns the credibility (0 to 100) and also the CATEGORY, which can be: Left Center, Unreliable, Conspiracy, Fake News, UNS (unspecified) ...

So it seems we have more information to display in our front end: the CREDIBILITY CATEGORY and SOURCE!!
The bbc.co.uk website has category UNS. I asked the question to their support team (answer attached). I can show more details tomorrow :)
