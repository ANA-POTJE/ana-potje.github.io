       "'Chief Scientific Officer Sir Patrick Vallance says measures must be taken to stop the spread of Covid-19.The UK could see 50,000 new coronavirus cases a day by mid-October without further action, the government\\'s chief scientific adviser has warned.Sir Patrick Vallance said that would be expected to lead to about \"200-plus deaths per day\" a month after that.It comes as the PM prepares to chair a Cobra emergency committee meeting on Tuesday morning, then make a statement in the House of Commons.On Sunday, a further 3,899 daily cases and 18 deaths were reported in the UK.Speaking at Downing Street alongside chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, Sir Patrick stressed the figures given were not a prediction, but added: \"At the moment we think the epidemic is doubling roughly every seven days.\"If, and that\\'s quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day.\"Fifty-thousand cases per day would be expected to lead a month later, so the middle of November say, to 200-plus deaths per day.\"The challenge, therefore, is to make sure the doubling time does not stay at seven days.\"That requires speed, it requires action and it requires enough in order to be able to bring that down.\"Prof Whitty added that if cases continued to double every seven days as Sir Patrick had set out, then the UK could \"quickly move from really quite small numbers to really very large numbers because of that exponential process\".\"So we have, in a bad sense, literally turned a corner, although only relatively recently,\" he said.Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said:The rising case numbers could not be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an \"increase in positivity of the tests done\"Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study)Less than 8% of the population has been infected, although the figure could be as high as 17% in LondonThe rising transmission is a \"six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively\"The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contraryIt is possible \"that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups\" but \"the first half of next year\" is much more likelyThe government\\'s most senior science and medical advisers are clearly concerned about the rise in cases that have been seen in recent weeks.The warning about 50,000 cases a day by mid-October is stark. We don\\'t know for sure how many cases there were at the peak in spring (as there was very limited testing in place) although some estimates put it at 100,000.However, they were also at pains to point out it was not a prediction - for one thing the \"Rule of Six\" which came in just a week ago has not had time to have an impact.Even among the government\\'s own advisers there is disagreement over whether what we are seeing is the start of an exponential rise or just a gradual increase in cases, which is what you would expect at this time of year as respiratory viruses tend to circulate more with the reopening of society.Instead, what was quite telling was the clear social messaging. Even those who are not at a high risk of complications should, they say, play their part in curbing the spread of the virus because if it spreads then difficult decisions will be needed that have profound societal consequences.But the big unanswered question is what ministers will do next. There is talk of further restrictions being introduced, but that is far from certain.A couple of things are in our favour that were not in the spring. Better treatments for those who get very sick are now available, while the government is in a better position to protect the vulnerable groups.Should ministers wait and see what happens? Or should they crack down early, knowing that will have a negative impact in other ways?Prof Whitty also said that even though different parts of the UK were seeing cases rising at different rates, and even though some age groups are affected more than others, the evolving situation \"is all of our problem\".He added that evidence from other countries showed infections were \"not staying just in the younger age groups\" but were \"moving up the age bands\".He said mortality rates from Covid-19 were \"significantly greater\" than seasonal flu, which killed around 7,000 annually or 20,000 in a bad year.The briefing comes as areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will face further local restrictions from Tuesday.And additional lockdown restrictions will \"almost certainly\" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to speak with leaders of devolved administrations later.\"Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that,\" Ms Sturgeon said.Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: \"It may be the case that UK-wide measures will be taken but that will require all four governments to exercise our varying share of power and responsibility to do so.\"It is not a question of \"if\".Downing Street will have to introduce extra restrictions to try to slow down the dramatic resurgence of coronavirus.You would only have to have dipped into a minute or two of the sober briefing from the government\\'s most senior doctor and scientist on Monday morning to see why.What is not yet settled however, is exactly what, exactly when, and indeed, exactly where these restrictions will be.Here\\'s what it is important to know:The government is not considering a new lockdown across the country right now.The prime minister is not about to tell everyone to stay at home as he did from the Downing Street desk in March.Ministers have no intention at all to close schools again.Nor, right now, are they planning to tell every business, other than the non-essential, to close again.What is likely is some kind of extra limits on our huge hospitality sector.Read more from Laura here.On Sunday, the prime minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Prof Whitty, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to discuss possible further measures for England.Asked about reports of disagreements among cabinet ministers about whether or not to impose a second lockdown, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: \"A conversation, a debate, is quite proper and that is exactly what you\\'d expect.\"Everyone recognises there is a tension between... the virus and the measures we need to take, and the economy and ensuring people\\'s livelihoods are protected.\"Prof Karol Sikora, from the University of Buckinghamshire and former director of the World Health Organization\\'s cancer programme, said blanket restrictions were \"not the way forward\".\"The most important thing is to target the groups that we need to protect and to let everybody else get on with their business - schools, shops and so on,\" he told BBC Radio 4\\'s World at One.Labour, meanwhile, has also urged the government to avoid a second national lockdown.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"This rapid spike in infections was not inevitable, but a consequence of the government\\'s incompetence and failure to put in place an adequate testing system.\"Labour\\'s priority is that there must be a national effort to prevent another national lockdown.\"The government must do what it takes to prevent another lockdown, which would cause unimaginable damage to our economy and people\\'s wellbeing.\"'"

      "\"If, and that's quite a big if, but if that continues unabated, and this grows, doubling every seven days... if that continued you would end up with something like 50,000 cases in the middle of October per day.\n",

      "0.11238095238095239\n",
      "\"Prof Whitty added that if cases continued to double every seven days as Sir Patrick had set out, then the UK could \"quickly move from really quite small numbers to really very large numbers because of that exponential process\".\n",
      "0.07408521303258148\n",
      "\"So we have, in a bad sense, literally turned a corner, although only relatively recently,\" he said.Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick also said:The rising case numbers could not be blamed on an increase in testing as there is also an \"increase in positivity of the tests done\"Around 70,000 people in the UK are estimated to currently have the disease - and about 6,000 per day are catching it (based on an ONS study)Less than 8% of the population has been infected, although the figure could be as high as 17% in LondonThe rising transmission is a \"six-month problem that we have to deal with collectively\"The virus is not milder now than in April, despite claims to the contraryIt is possible \"that some vaccine could be available before the end of the year in small amounts for certain groups\" but \"the first half of next year\" is much more likelyThe government's most senior science and medical advisers are clearly concerned about the rise in cases that have been seen in recent weeks.The warning about 50,000 cases a day by mid-October is stark.\n",
      "0.30578231292517005\n",
      "We don't know for sure how many cases there were at the peak in spring (as there was very limited testing in place) although some estimates put it at 100,000.However, they were also at pains to point out it was not a prediction - for one thing the \"Rule of Six\" which came in just a week ago has not had time to have an impact.Even among the government's own advisers there is disagreement over whether what we are seeing is the start of an exponential rise or just a gradual increase in cases, which is what you would expect at this time of year as respiratory viruses tend to circulate more with the reopening of society.Instead, what was quite telling was the clear social messaging.\n",

      "0.024143692564745203\n",
      "Or should they crack down early, knowing that will have a negative impact in other ways?Prof Whitty also said that even though different parts of the UK were seeing cases rising at different rates, and even though some age groups are affected more than others, the evolving situation \"is all of our problem\".He added that evidence from other countries showed infections were \"not staying just in the younger age groups\" but were \"moving up the age bands\".He said mortality rates from Covid-19 were \"significantly greater\" than seasonal flu, which killed around 7,000 annually or 20,000 in a bad year.The briefing comes as areas in north-west England, West Yorkshire, the Midlands and four more counties in south Wales will face further local restrictions from Tuesday.And additional lockdown restrictions will \"almost certainly\" be put in place in Scotland in the next couple of days, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to speak with leaders of devolved administrations later.\n",
      "0.0\n",
      "\"Hopefully this will be with four-nations alignment, but if necessary it will have to happen without that,\" Ms Sturgeon said.Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething added: \"It may be the case that UK-wide measures will be taken but that will require all four governments to exercise our varying share of power and responsibility to do so.\n",

      "\"The most important thing is to target the groups that we need to protect and to let everybody else get on with their business - schools, shops and so on,\" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One.Labour, meanwhile, has also urged the government to avoid a second national lockdown.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: \"This rapid spike in infections was not inevitable, but a consequence of the government's incompetence and failure to put in place an adequate testing system.\n",

       "\"THERE are only 14 road bridges across the Thames in central London, and now one of them is shut. Indefinitely.The sludge green Hammersmith Bridge is apparently so weak that not even a mouse is allowed to cross it.8 Jeremy Clarkson is not impressed with the closure of Hammersmith Bridge Credit: Getty - ContributorAnd because it may collapse at any moment, not even a stickleback is allowed to swim underneath it.The effects of this are enormous. Kids are now being forced to do three-hour trips to get to a school which is only a few hundred yards from where they live.Old ladies are saying that it takes them half a day, on an endless series of buses, to get to the doctor’s.And the closure is making Britain look like a laughing stock.The New York Times ran a story last week saying that London’s bridges really are falling down.So you’d imagine that teams of engineers in sturdy shoes and hard hats are working round the clock to find a solution. Sadly not.8 A task force has been set up to study fixing the bridge Credit: Press AssociationHammersmith and Fulham council, which owns the bridge, says it can’t afford to do the necessary repairs.And Transport for London say it’s not their problem.They can’t even agree on how big the problem is.One report last week said that, before the closure, the bridge was carrying 16,000 people a day and 22,000 vehicles.Really? So some of these vehicles had no people in them?Now, if I were transport minister, I would call a meeting of all the people in charge and explain, while brandishing an extremely large machine gun, that if they couldn’t get the problem solved in six months, everyone involved would go to prison for the rest of their lives.8 Transport minister Grant Shapps has set up a government task force Credit: PA:Press AssociationBut I’m not the transport minister. Grant Shapps is.And what he’s done is set up a government task force.What good’s that, you imbecile? The Government can never do anything.It doesn’t order aprons when a pandemic is coming. It can’t understand that contractors take the p*** when supplying quotes.It supplies troops in a war zone with chef’s trousers, not guns.It buys aircraft carriers when it has no planes that can land on them.8 Why can't the Government do anything properly, asks Clarkson Credit: spegel.coIt lets the police stand around while people daub Churchill’s statue with slogans saying he was a racist.It thinks it has a Brexit deal when it doesn’t. It gives foreign aid to countries which are richer than we are.It has no control of our borders. It sells our gold when prices are rock bottom. It has no idea how many people live here.It starts wars when it has no idea how to finish them.And when it decided to throw us a New Year’s Eve party in December 1999, it put up a tent filled with faith zones and bugger all else.The Chinese government could cope. In fact it did. When a bridge in Beijing — which had about the same span as Hammersmith Bridge — developed a fault, they had a replacement up and running in 43 hours.Not months. Not weeks. Hours!!!And I’m sorry, but if we want that kind of drive and panache here, there’s only one solution. Hand the problem over to the private sector.Tell a construction company they can charge tolls if they can put up a new bridge quickly, and I guarantee they’d have the job done by Monday morning at about 10.30.Which means that on Monday afternoon they could start work on repairing Brighton West Pier, which burned down 17 years ago and is now just sitting there looking like a set of ruined, blackened teeth stumps in the mouth of a former supermodel who developed a fondness for crystal meth.There's no fun in fungiIF you go for a walk in the countryside at this time of year, you’ll find that many fields are carpeted with a thick layer of mushrooms.You can eat all of them. But some of them only once.8 Stay away from wild mushrooms, says Clarkson Credit: Getty Images - GettyAnd that’s the problem. Some mushrooms will kill you stone dead in about 20 seconds.Some will make you fall about laughing at stuff that isn’t funny, such as Keir Starmer’s hair, and some are absolutely delicious.But how do you tell which is which?Happily, a new app was launched this week which helps you do just that.But sadly, there are lots of apps which claim to do the same thing and many have been branded “misleading” by experts.And that’s like having “misleading” advice at a level crossing.Which is why I always get my mushrooms from the safest place of all: The supermarket.German Koch-up THE German army has just cut its ties with its home gunmaker, Heckler & Koch, saying that in future it will get its hardware from a company in the Middle East. But it’s not the end of the world as Heckler & Koch won a £65million order from the British Army last year. Mind you, if history repeats itself and we end up having another war with Germany there’s going to be the most awful kerfuffle about who uses which guns.What the Elle will they do8 Where will Elle Macpherson go on holiday this year? Credit: BackGridSO, a crashed oil tanker has ruined the beaches in Mauritius, Islamic militants have seized a cluster of idyllic islands off Mozambique and now comes news that Barbados is ditching the Queen as its head of state and becoming a republic.At this rate there’ll be nowhere for the world’s bikini enthusiasts, such as Elle Macpherson, to go on holiday when this Covid business eventually ends.No way Jose8 It's hard not to like Jose Mourinho when you watch All Or Nothing Credit: Rex FeaturesAMAZON’S All Or Nothing documentary, which follows Spurs over one tumultuous year, is a masterclass in programme making, and a fascinating insight into how a football club works behind the scenes.I have hated every minute of it. Because as a Chelsea fan, I don’t want to see Dele Alli being funny and Heung-Min Son being brilliant and Eric Dier talking about his vegetable garden.Nor do I want to see Jose Mourinho winning anything.I want to hate these people and it’s bloody hard to do that when you get to know them.Blimey, greens get itI NEVER thought I’d see the day, but this week Greenpeace made an announcement and I found myself nodding in agreement.They are saying that so-called “green” plug-in hybrids are nothing of the sort because while many only produce 44g of carbon dioxide for every kilometre in laboratory tests, that shoots up to 117g in the real world.8 Hybrid cars fail to deliver on their promises, say Greenpeace Credit: Getty Images - GettyIt means that many produce nearly as much greenhouse gas as a standard petrol car. I’ve been saying that for years.And actually the problem is even worse, because a hybrid has two engines, which have to be manufactured in massive factories.Most read in News Breaking LAST ORDERS Pubs to close at 10pm across England as covid alert level RISES to 4 STAY AT HOME £500 for low-income Brits to self-isolate and stop spread of coronavirus GRINCHES Mum reveals HUGE Xmas gift haul for daughter - but some parents brand kid 'spoilt' VIRAL SPREAD Coronavirus map of England revealed - as cases rise for majority of country HIT & SCUM Hit & run driver ploughs in to man - only to find later it was her father-in-law 'I'LL END UP DEAD' Moment Snapchat idiot hangs out of '110mph' car on M25 - and falls outAnd a heavy bank of batteries which have to be made using stuff dug out of mines in Africa, by children.If you really want to be as green as can be, you need a pure electric car.
